# Resume Screener

A two-stage system that predicts a resume's job category, then scores how well it actually fits a specific job description — trained on a small, real-world resume dataset and deployed as an interactive Streamlit app.

## 🚀 Live App

## Problem

Screening resumes against open roles is normally a manual, time-consuming process. This project builds a lightweight two-stage pipeline that automates the first pass:

1. **Stage 1 — Category Classifier**: predicts what kind of role a resume belongs to (HR, IT, Finance, Chef, etc.)
2. **Stage 2 — Suitability Scoring**: given a resume and a specific job description, scores how good a fit it actually is — not just which category it belongs to, but how well its content matches the posting

## Dataset

### Stage 1 — Resumes

- **Source**: [Resume Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset) (Kaggle)
- **Size**: 2,484 resumes across 24 job categories
- **Columns used**: `Resume_str` (raw resume text), `Category` (label)

The raw CSV isn't included in this repo (GitHub has file size limits, and it's easy to grab directly from Kaggle). To reproduce training: download `Resume.csv` from the link above and upload it when the notebook prompts for it.

### Stage 2 — Resume-Job Pairs

- **Source**: [job_resume_fit](https://huggingface.co/datasets/batuhanmtl/job_resume_fit) (Hugging Face)
- **Size**: 2,385 resume-job posting pairs across 23 categories, built from the same source resume dataset as Stage 1
- **Columns used**: `resume_text`, `job_text`, `category`, `job_required_skills`, `resume_skill_list`, `ai_match_score` (training target), `skill_string_match_score`, `fuzzy_match_score`

This dataset is pulled directly in the notebook via `datasets.load_dataset("batuhanmtl/job_resume_fit")` — no manual download needed.

### Data Cleaning (Stage 1)

- Dropped 2 pairs of exact duplicate resumes and 1 near-empty resume (under 10 words)
- Stripped stray HTML tags and collapsed irregular whitespace left over from the original scrape
- Merged `Consultant`, `Business-Development`, and `Sales` into one `Business` category — the confusion matrix showed these were constantly mistaken for each other, since the language genuinely overlaps
- Dropped `Automobile` and `BPO` — too few samples (under 40) to learn a reliable pattern from
- Result: 24 raw categories → 20 usable categories

## Stage 1 — Category Classifier

- **Vectorizer**: `TfidfVectorizer` (unigrams + bigrams, English stop words removed, max 10,000 features)
- **Classifier**: `LogisticRegression` (`class_weight='balanced'`, `solver='lbfgs'`)

### Results

**Accuracy: 68.0%**

| Category | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|---|---|---|---|
| Information-Technology | 0.64 | 0.96 | 0.77 |
| HR | 0.83 | 0.91 | 0.87 |
| Fitness | 0.94 | 0.71 | 0.81 |
| Construction | 0.85 | 0.77 | 0.81 |
| Business | 0.66 | 0.50 | 0.57 |
| Apparel | 0.44 | 0.42 | 0.43 |

Full per-category breakdown: [`table_classification_report.csv`](table_classification_report.csv)

A random baseline across 20 categories would score ~5% — 68% reflects real learned signal, with the main bottleneck being dataset size (~2,400 resumes) rather than model choice.

### Confusion Matrix

![Confusion Matrix](chart_confusion_matrix.png)

Most remaining confusion is concentrated in categories with genuine content overlap — see [`table_confusion_mistakes.csv`](table_confusion_mistakes.csv) for the full breakdown.

## Stage 2 — Suitability Scoring

The `job_resume_fit` dataset only pairs resumes with jobs they were actually matched against — every real example is some flavor of "decent fit." To teach the model what a *bad* fit looks like, synthetic negative pairs were added: resumes paired with a job from a different category, labeled with a low synthetic score (0-15). This is a heuristic assumption, not ground-truth data, but it meaningfully improved the model — see results below.

### Features (8 total)

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `skill_overlap_ratio` | % of the job's required skills found in the resume's skill list |
| `skill_overlap_count` | Raw count of overlapping skills |
| `length_ratio` | How close resume and job description lengths are |
| `text_similarity` | TF-IDF cosine similarity between full resume and job text |
| `skill_text_similarity` | TF-IDF cosine similarity between just the skill lists |
| `embedding_similarity` | Sentence-transformer (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) cosine similarity between resume and job text |
| `skill_string_match_score` | Provided by the dataset (original author's scoring pipeline) |
| `fuzzy_match_score` | Provided by the dataset (original author's scoring pipeline) |

### Model Comparison

| Model | MAE | R² |
|---|---|---|
| **Gradient Boosting (final)** | **8.69** | **0.814** |
| Tuned Random Forest (GridSearchCV) | 8.98 | 0.801 |
| Random Forest (default) | 9.04 | 0.799 |

### Predicted vs Actual

### Feature Importance

![Feature Importance](chart_feature_importance.png)

Plain TF-IDF `text_similarity` ended up the dominant feature (~47% importance) — the sentence-embedding feature, expected to add meaningful semantic understanding, contributed only ~6%. This suggests resume-job fit in this dataset is driven more by shared vocabulary than by paraphrased meaning — a useful negative result, not a bug.

### What the negative pairs fixed

Before adding synthetic negative examples, HR and Information-Technology had the worst per-category error (20.7 and 18.5 average absolute error) despite being among the *best*-classified categories in Stage 1 — likely because these categories have the widest real-world range of "good" vs "bad" fit, and the model had nothing to contrast against. After adding negative pairs, HR's error dropped to ~11.5. Full breakdown: [`table_category_error.csv`](table_category_error.csv).

### A real test case

| Test | Suitability Score |
|---|---|
| HR resume vs. genuine HR job posting | 51.8 — Moderate fit |
| Same HR resume vs. unrelated Chef job posting | 2.8 — Weak fit |

A ~49-point gap between a genuine match and a deliberate mismatch, using the deployed app itself — concrete evidence the model is picking up on real content alignment, not just rewarding generic professional-sounding text.

## Honest Limitations

- **Approximated match scores**: `skill_string_match_score` and `fuzzy_match_score` in the training data came from the original dataset author's private scoring pipeline. The live app's `score_resume_against_job()` function uses its own honest approximations (word-boundary skill matching, `difflib` fuzzy matching) — not the exact original formula.
- **Small training set**: 2,484 resumes across 20+ categories means some categories (Agriculture, Apparel) have only a few dozen examples. 68% Stage 1 accuracy reflects a genuinely hard, data-limited problem more than a modeling shortfall.
- **Category errors can propagate**: if Stage 1 misclassifies a resume's category, that mistake doesn't feed directly into Stage 2's features, but a systematically wrong category signal upstream can still color how results should be interpreted downstream.

## App Features

- **Try It**: paste a resume and job description, get a predicted category (with confidence breakdown) and a suitability score
- **Model Performance**: live charts and metrics for both stages
- **Model & Method**: full pipeline walkthrough, key engineering decisions, and the limitations above

## Usage

```python
import joblib
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

clf = joblib.load('category_classifier.pkl')
vectorizer = joblib.load('tfidf_vectorizer.pkl')
suitability_model = joblib.load('suitability_model.pkl')
vectorizer_s2 = joblib.load('suitability_vectorizer.pkl')
skill_vectorizer = joblib.load('skill_vectorizer.pkl')
embed_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# see app.py for the full score_resume_against_job() implementation

## Tech Stack

- `scikit-learn` — TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- `sentence-transformers` — semantic embedding similarity (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- `datasets` (Hugging Face) — loading the resume-job pairs dataset
- `pandas` / `numpy` — data handling
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` — visualization
- `streamlit` — deployed app interface
- `joblib` — model persistence

## Possible Next Steps

- Recreate `skill_string_match_score` and `fuzzy_match_score` from scratch with a documented formula, rather than relying on the original dataset's black-box versions
- Expand the resume dataset (more categories, more samples per category) to push Stage 1 accuracy past the current data-limited ceiling
- Feed Stage 1's predicted category into Stage 2 as an explicit feature for a brand-new (unlabeled) resume, rather than only using it at inference time for display
